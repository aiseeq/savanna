# Промпты для анимации зайца - стиль с повторами

**Базовое животное:** Африканский саванный заяц (Scrub Hare) - крупный, заметный, с характерной окраской.

**Стратегия:** Повторяем VISUAL STYLE и RABBIT PATTERN в каждом промпте для предотвращения дрейфа стиля.

**КРИТИЧНО для анимации:** В парах кадров Walk/Run каждая лапа должна иметь УНИКАЛЬНУЮ позицию. Никакая лапа не должна повторять свою позицию между кадрами - это убивает эффект анимации!
